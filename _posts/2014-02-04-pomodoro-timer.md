I have recently been interested in the ATtiny85 microcontroller. Its minimalistic,
yet powerful features make it a very attractive platform for simple hacks and gadgets.
In addition, I had been interested in learning the technique of
[charlieplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing), i.e. controlling
many LEDs with very few pins. The ATtiny85, with its 5 GPIO pins available by default
(sacrificing ISP yields an extra pin, but I didn't want to go down that road), seemed
like the perfect candidate.

I decided to build a custom timer for the 
[pomodoro technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/). This is a technique to increase
productivity by splitting time into slices of 25 minutes of work followed by a 5 minutes
rest period. The technique proposes normally to use a tomato shaped kitchen
timer to keep track of time, but I will be designing and building my own.

All the schematics, board files, and firmware are available in the project 
[github repo](https://github.com/fakufaku/Pomodoro). Feel free to reuse anything!

The design
----------

We lay down here the basic design for our project. Our pomodoro timer will need
the following components to be useful.

* __Time keeper__ The primary feature necessary for a timer is something to keep
    track of time. To minimize part count and save some pins, we will not rely on
    an external crystal. Instead, we use the ATtiny85 _TIMER1_.
* __User interface__ A user interface is needed in order to start and stop the timer.
    Our minimalistic interface will be a single tactile switch. Here, I also decided
    to avoid a main power switch. Instead, the AVR will go into deep sleep, which
    should be energy efficient enough for this project. To wake up from sleep, the
    tactile switch is connected to _INT0_
* __Feedback__ A buzzer is need to give a discrete signal when the timer
    expires. The buzzer is driven by _TIMER0_ in PWM mode at 4 kHz, 50% duty
    cycle. I picked an SMD buzzer that does not have a built-in driver, so I
    needed to add a few components for this.
* __Extra fun__ As many LEDs as possible to indicate the progress of the timer.
    By default, the ATtiny85 has 5 GPIO pins (we could add an extra one, but
    would lose ISP).  We have thus 3 GPIO remaining.   We assign all of them to
    LEDs and using [charlieplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing), 
    it is possible to drive 6 LEDs using only 3 pins. We choose 5 yellow, for
    every 5 minutes slice of the first timer, and a single red one, for the _rest
    time_ of the second timer.
* __Power__ The board is powered by a CR2032 lithium coin cell. These have plenty
    of juice and a sleek low profile.

The resulting schematic follows.

Board design
------------

My goal was to print the circuit board a the 
[ACI Atelier pour le routage et la fabrication de circuits imprim√©s](http://sti-ateliers.epfl.ch/page-19942.html)
at [my university](http://www.epfl.ch). There is there a fabulously equipped PCB
fabrication laboratory for students. The machines are from the 70's and can print
professional quality (for that era) circuit boards. I have been using it several
time already and wanted this time to try some very fine details.

Also, I don't like having to drill many holes in the PCB, so I went for an all
SMD single-sided design. I picked the SOIC-8 version of the ATtiny85, generic
0805 resistors and LEDs.  Maybe the notable element is this very neat [SMD
buzzer](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Kobitone/254-PB501-ROX/?qs=%2fha2pyFaduio21Wb3%2fEgDw7Itv2u2RCUk%252bCSGDldQmgXvX6wRiKaqw%3d%3d).
However, this buzzer has no driving circuit integrated so I need to add this to
the design (transistor and inductor). For programming, I added the footprint for
a six-pin ISP header. The programming can then be done by pressing some pogo pins
to the header footprint.

Here is the PCB that came out of fab. We can recognize on top the footprint
for the coin cell holder. The board is about 4x4 cm.

The finest tracks here are only 0.2 mm wide. For such precision, the bottleneck
is the mask. I use transparency sheets with the mask printed on a generic laser
printer. To obtain very opaque mask, it is important to select transparency
paper and overlap two prints.

I was also very happy with the very regular Charlieplexing design I obtained, and
visible in the lower left.


Here is the final product with all components soldered.

Code design
-----------

Here is how we would like our gadget to behave.

1. One click starts a 25 minutes _work_ counter. Five yellow LED indicates how
  many slices of five minutes are left. There is a discrete beep when the timer
  expires. The LED then flashes to remind you to go into _rest_ mode.
  It is also possible to skip to _rest_ before the end of the counter by pressing
  the button.
2. A second click starts a 5 minutes _rest_ counter. A **red** LED is turned on.
  There is a discrete beep when it expires. Then the timer turns off.
3. If you wish the turn the timer off during _rest_ mode, click a third time the button.

The code is completely interrupt driven. _TIMER1_ and its overflow interrupt
are used to keep track of time during each state. The tactile switch triggers
an interrupt to wake up the AVR, or switch between states. The [finite state
machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) looks like this.
Blue arrows are state switching triggered by a push on the button. Red arrows
are switching caused by the timer expiration.

The _main_ states are black circles. The grey circles are the transition states.
It was important to add the `BACKOFF` state to debounce the tactile button because it triggered multiple interrupts.
