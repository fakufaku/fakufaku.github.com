When designing a printed circuit board to fit in a box of a given size,
there is always the fear that when the fabbed PCB arrives, it doesn't fit.

If the box designed for is at hand, it is easy to print the layout at scale 1:1,
cut the outline with scissors and just check how neatly it fits!

I know it's not rocket science, but I thought the picture looks kinda pretty :)
